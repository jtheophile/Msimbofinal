“If there is no struggle, there is no progress. Those who profess to favor freedom, and yet depreciate agitation, are men who want crops without plowing up the ground. They want rain without thunder and lightning. They want the ocean without the awful roar of its many waters. This struggle may be a moral one; or it may be a physical one; or it may be both moral and physical; but it must be a struggle.”

Or do you know great groups who you think can do a phenomenal project together? Suggest a collaboration, who knows maybe they'll make it happen. You know what they say about seeds ;)!</p>
